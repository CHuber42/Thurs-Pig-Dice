|  Behavior                 |  Input  | Output
|---------------------------|---------|-------
| **Spec 1: Buttons for "pass" and "roll"** | |
| **Spec 2: Write vars to hold: This turn's score (1/2 vars?) and each player's total score (2 vars)** | |
| **Spec 3: Assign players IDs to track which player's turn it is** | |
| **Spec 4: write function for "pass turn": add turn score to player's total score, set turn score to 0, and change player ID** | |
| **Spec 5: add condition to "pass" function: is player's score > 100? If so, end game and declare winner**  | |
| **Spec 6+: On "roll" button: generate random int 1-6**    | |
| **Spec 7: int 2-6, add to this turn's score** | |
| **Spec 8: On roll 1: set this turn's score to 0, call pass turn function**  | |

**Optional Specs: Roll more than 1 die**
| **Spec 9: Select box + Global Var to indicate how many dice to roll** |
| **Spec 10: Have variant/derivative function(s) for each respective value; ie "rollOne(), rollTwo(), etc** |
| **Spec 11: Bundle Spec 10 into a "manager" function that receives # of dice to roll and selects correct func to call** |

**Optional Specs: Computer AI**
| **Spec 12: Select box + Global Var to decide/check if playing vs AI** |
| **Spec 13: Create if/while loop; on turn change, check if "vs computer" and if player's turn is 1; if so, execute AI loop** |
| **Spec 14: quantify behavior for AI's turn; ex: if this turn's score > 9, pass, else, keep rolling** |
